## Technical Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Ollama installed and running with your preferred model

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RSS.git
cd RSS
```

2. Build and start the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Configure Ollama connection:
   - Access http://localhost:8501
   - In Settings (‚öôÔ∏è):
     - Set Ollama URL (`http://localhost:11434` for local, or `http://<ollama-host>:11434` for remote)
     - Select your preferred model from available models
     - Configure logging and debug settings if needed

### Data Persistence
The application uses Docker volumes for data persistence:
- `./data:/app/data` - Stores the SQLite database and configuration

## Usage Guide

### Main Interface Components

## Security Feed Features

Security-focused feeds receive additional analysis:

1. **IOC Extraction**
   - Identifies and categorizes potential indicators
   - Supports multiple IOC types (IPs, domains, hashes, URLs)
   - Presents findings in structured format

2. **Sigma Rule Generation**
   - Creates detection rules based on article content
   - Includes title, description, status, and level
   - Provides YAML-formatted rules for security tools

## Troubleshooting

1. **Ollama Connection Issues**
   - Verify Ollama is running (`ollama ps`)
   - Check URL configuration in settings
   - Ensure network connectivity
   - Verify model availability (`ollama list`)

2. **Feed Issues**
   - Check feed URL validity
   - Verify feed format (RSS/Atom)
   - Review debug console for detailed errors
   - Check feed update timestamp

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Adjust entries per feed limit
   - Use categories for better organization
   - Mark read entries to reduce clutter
   - Configure appropriate logging level
